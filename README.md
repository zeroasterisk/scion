# Scion

Run multiple agents in parallel — each in its own container, with its own workspace, collaborating on your code or project files simultaneously.

_sci·on /ˈsīən/ — a young shoot or twig, cut for grafting or rooting._

Scion is an experimental multi-agent orchestration testbed designed to manage "deep agents" running in containers.


Scion orchestrates "deep agents" (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others) as isolated, concurrent processes. Each agent gets its own container, git worktree, and credentials — so they can work on different parts of your project without stepping on each other. Agents run locally, on remote VMs, or across Kubernetes clusters.

Rather than prescribing rigid orchestration patterns, Scion takes a "less is more" approach: agents dynamically learn a CLI tool, letting the models themselves decide how to coordinate among agents. This makes it a rapid prototype testbed for experimenting with multi-agent patterns through natural language prompting.

## See It in Action

[Relics of Athenaeum](https://github.com/ptone/scion-athenaeum) is an "agent game" that demonstrates multi-agent orchestration defined entirely in markdown. A group of agents collaborate to solve computational puzzles, coordinating through group and direct messaging — all running in containers on off-the-shelf harnesses.

The visualization above replays the actual telemetry collected from messages and file access in the shared workspace while the agents solved the challenges of the game. While this is a "game", the same process of team definition works for software engineering, data research, and platform engineering workflows.

## Quick Start

### Workstation Quick Start (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install scion
scion server start
```

Your browser will open to the onboarding wizard at `http://127.0.0.1:9810/onboarding`, which walks you through machine setup, runtime detection, harness selection, and creating your first project.

### Install from Source

See the full [Installation Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/scion/getting-started/install/), or install from source (requires Go 1.22+):

```bash
go install github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/cmd/scion@latest
```

### Initialize your machine and a Project (project)

> **Tip:** If you used `scion server start` above, the onboarding wizard handles machine initialization automatically — you can skip this section.

Navigate to your project and create a Scion project (the `.scion` directory that holds agent config):

```bash
scion init --machine
cd my-project
scion init
```

> **Tip:** Add `.scion/agents` to your `.gitignore` to avoid issues with nested git worktrees.

Scion auto-detects your OS and configures the default runtime (Docker on Linux/Windows, Container on macOS). Override this in `.scion/settings.yaml`.

**NOTE** Currently this project is early and experimental. Most of the concepts are settled in, but many features may not be fully implemented, anything might break or change and the future is not set. Local use is relatively stable, Hub based workflows now highly usable, Kubernetes runtime support still has rough edges.

### Start Agents

```bash
# Start and immediately attach to the session
scion start debug "Help me debug this error" --attach
```

### Manage Agents

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `scion list` (`ps`) | List active agents |
| `scion attach <name>` | Attach to a running agent's tmux session |
| `scion message <name> "..."` (`msg`) | Send a message to a running agent |
| `scion logs <name>` | View agent logs |
| `scion stop <name>` | Stop an agent |
| `scion resume <name>` | Resume a stopped agent |
| `scion delete <name>` | Remove agent, container, and worktree |

## Key Features

- **Harness Agnostic** — Ships with Gemini CLI and Claude Code by default. Additional harnesses (OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity) are available as [opt-in bundles](harnesses/README.md). Adaptable to anything that runs in a container.
- **True Isolation** — Each agent runs in its own container with separated credentials, config, and a dedicated `git worktree`, preventing merge conflicts.
- **Parallel Execution** — Run multiple agents concurrently as fully independent processes, locally or remotely.
- **Attach / Detach** — Agents run in `tmux` sessions for background operation. Attach for human-in-the-loop interaction, enqueue messages while detached, and tunnel into remote agents securely.
- **Specialization via Templates** — Define agent roles ("Security Auditor", "QA Tester") with custom system prompts and skill sets. See [Templates](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/scion/advanced-local/templates/).
- **Multi-Runtime** — Manage execution across Docker, Podman, Apple containers, and Kubernetes via named profiles.
- **Observability** — Normalized OTEL telemetry across harnesses for logging and metrics across agent swarms.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent** | A containerized process running a deep agent harness (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) |
| **Project** | A project namespace and collection of agents, commonly 1:1 with a git repo |
| **Template** | An agent blueprint — system prompt plus a collection of skills |
| **Runtime** | A container runtime: Docker, Podman, Apple Container, or Kubernetes |
| **Hub** | Optional central control plane for multi-machine orchestration |
| **Runtime Broker** | A machine (laptop or VM) offering its runtimes to a Hub |

Not all concepts apply in every scenario — local mode is simpler. See [Concepts](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/scion/concepts/) for the full picture.

## Project Status

This project is early and experimental. Core concepts are settled, but expect rough edges:

- **Local mode** — relatively stable
- **Hub-based workflows** — ~80% verified
- **Kubernetes runtime** — early, with known rough edges
