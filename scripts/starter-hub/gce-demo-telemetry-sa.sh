# scripts/starter-hub/gce-demo-telemetry-sa.sh - Create GCP service account for agent telemetry export
#
# Creates a dedicated, least-privilege service account for writing telemetry
# data (traces, logs, metrics) to Google Cloud Observability. A JSON key is
# downloaded locally for injection into agent containers via the Hub secrets
# system.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/starter-hub/gce-demo-telemetry-sa.sh          # Create SA, grant roles, download key
#   ./scripts/starter-hub/gce-demo-telemetry-sa.sh delete    # Remove SA and local key file
#
# The key file is written to .scratch/telemetry-gcp-credentials.json
# (git-ignored). It should be uploaded to the Hub as a file-type secret named
# "scion-telemetry-gcp-credentials" with target "~/.scion/telemetry-gcp-credentials.json".
