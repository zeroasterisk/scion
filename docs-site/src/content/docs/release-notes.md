title: Release Notes
---

## Jun 8, 2026

This release strengthens the agent state and container lifecycle: agents can now be suspended and resumed with their harness session intact, crashes are surfaced as a restartable `error` state, and stalled agents are auto-suspended to reclaim resources.

### 🚀 Features
* **Suspend & Resume with Session Continuation:** `scion suspend <agent>` (and `--all`) now tears down an agent's container while preserving the intent to resume. Resuming — or simply running `scion start` on a suspended agent — *continues* the prior harness conversation (Claude Code via `--continue`, Gemini CLI via `--resume`) instead of starting fresh. Suspend is available for harnesses that support session resume and is also exposed in the Web Dashboard's lifecycle controls. See [Agent Lifecycle](/scion/advanced-local/agent-lifecycle/).
* **Auto-Suspend of Stalled Agents:** The Hub now automatically suspends agents that remain `stalled` past a grace period (~10 minutes of inactivity), reclaiming their containers. Such agents resume automatically on the next message, as long as their harness supports resume and the container is still alive.

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Crash → Restartable `error` State:** Agents that exit non-zero (a genuine crash, OOM, or `SIGKILL`) now transition to the `error` phase with a descriptive message like `Agent crashed with exit code N`, distinct from a clean `stopped` exit or a `limits_exceeded` stop. The `error` phase is restartable — `scion start` clears it and launches a fresh session. (A graceful `stop` sends `SIGTERM`, which harnesses handle cleanly, so stopping never leaves an agent in `error`.)

## Mar 17, 2026

This release introduces a major new GCP Identity implementation allowing agents to authenticate via metadata server emulation, alongside comprehensive new Grove Settings and Agent Limits configurations in the UI.

### 🚀 Features
* **GCP Identity & Metadata Emulation:** Implemented end-to-end GCP identity assignment for agents using metadata server emulation and token brokering. This includes a new Web UI for Service Account management, iptables interception, per-agent rate limiting, audit logging, and telemetry metrics (consolidated from commits 2ac33bb, 961653a, d37a79c, d11318f, a5f457a, d187838, 8df2a04, 34c7056, 401a178, 52f6838).
* **Grove Settings & Agent Limits:** Introduced a comprehensive Grove Settings UI organized into General, Limits, and Resources tabs. Administrators can now configure default agent limits at both the hub and grove levels, which automatically pre-populate when creating new agents (consolidated from commits c7d9585, aa5c2ff, 2ffdff8, 8f0263f, 0d87a17, 07714a1, 906a88d).
* **Workspace Content Previews:** Added content preview capabilities for workspace files directly within the UI (commit 53cea7c).
* **CLI Enhancements:** Added a `-r`/`--running` flag to the `scion list` command to easily filter for active agents (commit 7001035).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Grove & Membership Synchronization:** Resolved multiple issues with grove linking and membership backfills, including fixing unique constraints on grove IDs, ensuring proper legacy owner role assignments, and correctly including auto-provide brokers (consolidated from commits 4af2662, 307fb85, cb22a18, 79cc591, 1f6f16f, e14ec95).
* **Storage & ID Consistency:** Fixed global grove ID bleed-through issues and unified agent split storage paths under `.scion/` for deterministic behavior across hub-managed and external groves. Ensured cascading cleanups of templates and configs when a grove is deleted (consolidated from commits fea4588, 6bb2348, a97ebd7, 023a089, 6eaf8dc, 221c736, 75bfcc0, c9d8ddf).
* **GCP Validation & Logging:** Improved debug logging for 4xx errors and enhanced GCP Service Account validation messages, including returning capabilities in the list API response (consolidated from commits e060664, d65dc09).
* **Container Lifecycle Management:** Ensured agent containers are gracefully stopped before removal to prevent shared-directory mount errors (commit 8a0fabc).
* **Template Synchronization:** Fixed an issue where template synchronization was blocked by setting a default image for the generic harness config (commit 816c960).
* **Web UI Consistency:** Fixed layout issues such as status column widths in agent tables and exposed Scion version information on the admin config page (consolidated from commits 53f55b5, 7536c59).

## Mar 16, 2026

This release focuses on a major overhaul of user group and membership management with new authorization rules and UI enhancements, alongside significant improvements to the OpenTelemetry metrics pipeline.

### 🚀 Features
* **Group & Membership Management:** Overhauled the group management system by introducing human-friendly member editing, user search autocomplete in the add dialog, and strict enforcement of group ownership and authorization rules (consolidated from commits 1ae6d03, 454c80e, 5e32c9e, c2fa624).
* **Telemetry & Metrics Pipeline:** Enhanced the observability pipeline by exporting OTLP metrics through GCP, restoring Gemini token metric hooks, and covering Gemini native OTEL metrics (consolidated from commits 721da2b, 5e752f8, 28a9877, 4321775).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Group Constraint Fixes:** Resolved multiple backend issues related to group creation and loading, including fixing dev-user UUID mapping for workstation mode, backfilling grove member groups, and ensuring SQLite constraint compatibility (consolidated from commits 1993892, 4628e5f, e5c1eba, 6a4f843, 1a779c8, cb7c932).
* **Agent Lifecycle:** Implemented proper agent resume and restart dispatch logic on the hub (commit 30a1b74).
* **Grove Synchronization:** Fixed an issue with re-linking stale hub groves by ensuring the grove ID is regenerated from the marker file, and updated the UI to conditionally show the branch field only for git-based groves (consolidated from commits 39e0025, 2bab781).
* **Container Prune Operations:** Fixed the container runtime image pruning by removing the unsupported `-f` flag (commit ad9f486).
* **Environment & Security:** Improved GCE certificate checks (commit 8904e76).

## Mar 15, 2026

This release significantly hardens the agent workspace provisioning process for Hub-linked environments, introduces interactive terminal toolbar toggles for the web UI, and improves overall deterministic Grove ID generation and management.

### 🚀 Features
* **Hub-Linked Workspace Provisioning:** Transitioned hub-linked groves to strictly use a robust `git init` + `git fetch` strategy instead of standard cloning or local worktrees. This allows provisioning into workspaces that already contain `.scion` metadata or `.scion-volumes` directories while properly clearing out stale artifacts before initialization (consolidated from commits 3852e6a, 51be1e6, 118b518, 2f6b877, 2f59410, 4497a86, 6cc4487).
* **Terminal Toolbar Enhancements:** Added web toolbar toggles for managing tmux windows (seamlessly switching between agent and shell) and controlling mouse/clipboard behavior. Also fixed mouse-drag text selection and improved the robustness of the window controls using direct tmux key bindings (consolidated from commits 8c07a48, b83ba8c, 8027407, 6140111).
* **Deterministic Grove ID & Synchronization:** Enhanced deterministic Grove ID generation during hub-link sync. Git URL user info is now cleanly normalized to ensure UUID v5 grove IDs match regardless of the protocol (e.g., `https://` vs `git@`), and stale grove links are automatically detected and synchronized (consolidated from commits 6a52952, 1bfa95d, ed2b2c5).
* **Template Sync Improvements:** Enabled the template sync command to update existing templates without requiring the `--force` flag. Local templates now automatically sync on hub startup and intelligently bypass cache when running in co-located (hub-broker combo) mode (consolidated from commits ff14bd9, e0cf52d).
* **Web UI Flow & Performance:** Introduced route-based code splitting to significantly reduce the web bundle size. Additionally, refined the grove settings page by adding a "Done" button, hiding unnecessary registration options for git-backed groves, and introducing a confirmation dialog when creating a grove for an existing git repository (consolidated from commits 62e3e36, bd9f40e, b6d2afe, f715bf0).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Grove Deletion Cleanup:** Fixed an issue where environment variables, secrets, and harness configs were left orphaned; the system now performs a proper cascade delete when a grove is removed (commit 834bae9).
* **Agent Path & Directory Routing:** Corrected the routing of agent directories for git-backed groves to correctly use the grove-specific path instead of the global directory. Also properly resolved shared directory mount paths for git-based workspaces (consolidated from commits e38cf92, fbb9056).
* **Hub Unlinking & Local State:** Fixed a bug where the hub status erroneously showed "linked" after unlinking by verifying the local enabled state instead of mutating the global `grove_id`. The provider's `localPath` is also now properly preserved when re-registering an existing grove (consolidated from commits 0857553, 54fe4b8, 4db9253, d4828f1).
* **Agent Container Lifecycle:** Ensured that the agent container stops correctly and cleanly when the underlying agent process exits within the tmux session (commit 535ebbd).
* **Configuration & Path Resolution:** Fixed resolution logic for split-storage paths when writing grove settings, and ensured `git check-ignore` runs from the repository root so that broker `.gitignore` checks function correctly (consolidated from commits 7a4cd3c, f934b9a).
* **Web Assets & UI Styling:** Restored dark mode logic for Shoelace form components after implementing code splitting, and fixed the serving of root-level public assets (like the notification icon) from the Go backend (consolidated from commits ca1343f, b3d9484).
* **Network & Harness Config:** Preserved the hub port when applying container bridge endpoint overrides, and returned a synthetic harness config for "generic" agents to unblock template synchronization (consolidated from commits ff1635d, 713c3ab).

## Mar 14, 2026

This release introduces the foundational infrastructure for the Scion plugin system, adds comprehensive support for syncing grove-level templates, and unifies all Grove IDs to a standard UUID format.

:::danger[BREAKING CHANGES]
* **Grove ID Format Unification:** All Grove IDs have been standardized to a unified UUID format. Git-backed groves now use a deterministic UUID v5 (based on the namespace and normalized URL) instead of a 16-character hex hash, while non-git and hub-managed groves continue using UUID v4. Existing git-backed groves may need to be re-linked, and any integrations relying on the old hex format must be updated (commit e896693).

:::

### 🚀 Features
* **Plugin System Infrastructure:** Introduced the core architecture for a new Scion plugin system using `hashicorp/go-plugin`, complete with reference implementations for message broker and agent harness plugins (consolidated from commits 6c543d0, b1a5ae1, 22991ec).
* **Grove Template Sync & Management:** Implemented capabilities for syncing grove-level templates with the Hub. This includes new API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/groves/{groveId}/sync-templates`), CLI commands (`scion templates sync --all`, `scion templates status`), and a dedicated Web UI for managing synced templates. Additionally, machine-specific settings for git-backed groves are now externalized, while templates remain in-repo to support version control (consolidated from commits d0507b1, 3c9cb4b, 0cf62d7, ef4f208, 56df5b4).
* **CLI Navigation Commands:** Added `config dir`, `cd-config`, and `cd-grove` commands to simplify locating and navigating to configuration and workspace directories (commit 596295d).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Agent Git Cloning:** Resolved an issue where git clones would hang indefinitely when authentication was required but no token was present. Added proper error state reporting upon clone failures, and corrected the `agent-info.json` path to correctly use the `scion` user's home directory (consolidated from commits 93dfdcd, 7ec5eb2).
* **Image Builds:** Fixed the Google Cloud SDK installation in the build environment by explicitly using `apt-get` (commit d76197c).

## Mar 13, 2026

This release focuses on improving agent specialization with harness skills, resolving critical routing and identification issues in multi-hub and linked git environments, and adding a new satellite service for documentation agents.

:::danger[BREAKING CHANGES]
* **Linked Git Grove IDs:** Linked groves backed by a git remote now use deterministic 16-character hex hash IDs (e.g., generated via `HashGroveID()`) instead of the raw, normalized git URL. This resolves severe web routing and API path parsing issues caused by slashes in the URL. If you had existing linked groves, they may need to be re-linked, and any scripts relying on the raw git URL as the Grove ID will need to be updated (commit 05e0c7a).

:::

### 🚀 Features
* **Harness Skills for Templates:** Implemented robust support for harness skills within agent templates. Skills defined in `harness-configs` and templates are now automatically merged and mounted into the appropriate harness-specific directory (e.g., `.claude/skills`, `.gemini/skills`) during agent provisioning (consolidated from commits efefc44, 2a086ac, 5b54c66).
* **Docs-Agent Satellite Service:** Introduced a new `docs-agent` satellite service to provide dedicated documentation capabilities alongside agent workflows (consolidated from commits 092ffde, 58f21c2, fd1b1e2).
* **Shared Directory Management UI:** Added web UI support for managing and viewing grove shared directories (commit 7d7acfb).
* **Terminal & UX Enhancements:** Enabled tmux mouse mode by default for better terminal interactivity and introduced a custom Scion bell icon for browser notifications (commits c915da9, 343382e).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Multi-Hub Routing & Dispatch:**
    * Resolved an issue where brokers connected to multiple hubs would route agents to the wrong local hub endpoint by correctly resolving the endpoint from the control channel connection header.
    * Enabled control-channel-only brokers to successfully dispatch agent operations (consolidated from commits dd5581f, 1bdc31d).
* **Agent Creation Context:**
    * Ensured grove shared directories are properly passed from the hub to the broker during agent creation.
    * Fixed an issue where `agentDir` was omitted during harness provisioning and setting overlays (consolidated from commits a5cac3b, c550865).
* **Documentation & Web Hosting:** Corrected site base URLs, configured Astro for GitHub Pages deployment, fixed markdown links to use relative paths, and updated the README to point to the rendered site (consolidated from commits 35eee03, 8ca4a96, a7dc580, e133647, 2467d89).
* **Maintenance:** Internal refactoring analysis for `server.go` and documentation updates for recent feature releases (commits d3484d4, 33ee10e).

## Mar 12, 2026

This release focuses on enhancing persistent storage and system observability. It introduces **Grove Shared Directories**, enabling agents within a grove to share and persist mutable state via the filesystem (with native Kubernetes support). Additionally, the metrics pipeline has been significantly enriched with labels for harness type, model, and grove ID, providing deeper insights into agent performance and costs.

### 🚀 Features
* **Grove Shared Directories (Phase 1 & 2):** Introduced a persistent, mutable storage layer shared between agents within a single grove.
    * Added support for both local filesystem storage and Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) with grove-scoped lifecycle management.
    * New CLI commands added: `scion shared-dir list`, `create`, `remove`, and `info` for managing shared volumes.
    * Shared volumes can be mounted at standard paths (`/scion-volumes/<name>`) or within the workspace (`/workspace/.scion-volumes/<name>`) (consolidated from commits 838b1b9, a8d50f8, 8b860c0).
* **Enhanced Telemetry & Metrics Pipeline:** Major overhaul of the metrics pipeline for improved observability and aggregation.
    * Enriched OTel resource attributes with `scion.harness`, `scion.model`, `scion.broker`, and `grove_id`.
    * Expanded Codex-specific telemetry to capture tool usage, tool input/output, and detailed token counts (input, output, cached).
    * Injected `SCION_HARNESS` and `SCION_MODEL` environment variables into agent containers to enable harness-aware telemetry (consolidated from commit 8246a76).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Metrics & Telemetry Reliability:**
    * Resolved an issue where tool and API metrics were not recorded from unpaired end events.
    * Corrected the wiring of token and model metrics in the hook-to-OTel pipeline (consolidated from commits 2a64f02, 43f1bf0).
* **Agent Lifecycle & Configuration:**
    * Corrected an issue where custom branch names were not properly passed during the final environment setup path of agent creation (commit 46eee6d).
    * Updated the default model configuration for the Codex harness to `gpt-5.4` (commit fbfc950).
* **Maintenance:** Fixed broken documentation links in the repository README (commit 0f55876).

## Mar 11, 2026

This release focuses on improving agent lifecycle flexibility and enhancing the web-based terminal experience. It introduces support for targeting specific git branches during agent creation and provides better visibility into template versions, alongside critical fixes for runtime stability and authentication.

### 🚀 Features

* **Runtime & Broker Stability:** Improved Podman error handling and force-deletion reliability. Fixed a bug where `agent-limits.json` lacked correct permissions after creation and ensured `InlineConfig` is correctly propagated during agent restarts.
* **Logging Precision:** Established a dedicated HTTP request log stream using the standard `HttpRequest` format and removed misleading debug logs when running in GCP-native mode.
* **Build System:** Fixed a race condition in `make all` by ensuring web assets are fully built before the Go binary compilation begins.

## Mar 6, 2026

This release introduces Just-In-Time (JIT) agent configuration, an advanced agent creation interface, and native GCP telemetry integration, while centralizing profile management at the global level.

:::danger[BREAKING CHANGES]
* **Global Profile Management:** Runtime `profiles` and `runtimes` are no longer supported in grove-level `settings.yaml`. These must now be managed exclusively at the global/broker level (`~/.scion/settings.yaml`). Existing grove-specific profiles must be migrated to the global configuration.

:::

### 🚀 Features
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Agent Configuration:** Completed Phases 1 & 2 of the inline agent configuration refactor. Agents now support dynamic, late-bound configuration overrides at runtime, enabling more flexible and adaptive agent behavior.
* **Advanced Agent Creation Form:** Launched a comprehensive advanced configuration interface in the Web UI. This allows for granular control over agent parameters, including model selection, resource limits, and specific harness settings during creation.
* **GCP-Native Telemetry Integration:** Introduced native support for Google Cloud Trace and Cloud Logging telemetry exporters. The system now automatically detects GCP credentials and configures the appropriate exporter mode, facilitating seamless observability in Google Cloud environments.
* **Enhanced Developer Workflow:** Improved the developer experience with automated mounting of the `sciontool` binary and a dedicated `SCION_DEV_BINARIES` directory, enabling rapid iteration and testing of local changes within agent containers.
* **Branding & UI Refresh:** Updated the application branding with a new seedling logo and favicon, and added detailed visibility of the resolved harness authentication method in the agent detail view.
* **Local Networking Automation:** Automated the computation of the `ContainerHubEndpoint` for Podman and Docker when running in combined hub-broker mode, simplifying local setup and networking.

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Telemetry & Auth Propagation:** Resolved several issues where telemetry settings, harness authentication, and configuration overrides were not consistently propagated through all broker and agent startup paths.
* **Agent Lifecycle Stability:** Fixed a bug where provisioning agents were not correctly cleaned up after an aborted environment-gathering session.
* **Claude Harness Authentication:** Corrected Vertex AI authentication detection for the Claude harness when using file-based secrets.
* **Data Integrity:** Fixed a bug in the advanced agent creation form where the applied configuration was not correctly populated with resolved values.

## Mar 5, 2026

This release introduces a major overhaul of the agent authentication pipeline, automated token refresh, and critical stability fixes for container removal and terminal reliability.

:::danger[BREAKING CHANGES]
* **Credential Key Migration:** The internal secret key `OAUTH_CREDS` has been renamed to `GEMINI_OAUTH_CREDS`. Users must migrate existing secrets to this new key to maintain Gemini harness functionality.
* **Harness Auth Refactor:** Legacy harness-specific authentication methods have been retired in favor of a unified `ResolvedAuth` pipeline. Custom harness implementations or manual environment overrides may require updates to align with the new late-binding logic.

:::
